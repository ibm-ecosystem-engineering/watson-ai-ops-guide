Note: Humio is used in the architecture. But you can use LogDNA as well.

Here is the overall steps to be done for Similar Incidents. As part of this article, we will do the checked steps.

- [ ] 1. Integrate Slack at AI-Manager Instance level
- [ ] 2. Create Application Group
- [ ] 3. Integrate Topology Manager (ASM) at App Group level
- [ ] 4. Create Application (bookinfo)
- [ ] 5. Train Log Anomaly Models (LogDNA)
- [ ] 6. Train Incidents
- [ ] 7. Integrate LogDNA at app level
- [ ] 8. Integrate NOI at app level
- [X] 9. Introduce Log Anomaly at BookInfo app
- [X] 10. View new Incident in a slack story
